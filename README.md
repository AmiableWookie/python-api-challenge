Course: UO Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp

The goal of this repository's deliverables is to work with APIs to visualize weather and location data, then identify accomodations in ideal locations. The weather data used for this exercise is from OpenWeatherMap API, and the Geoapify API was used for hotel location data. Inspiration for the structure of the code was provided by the UO Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp staff and instructor.
